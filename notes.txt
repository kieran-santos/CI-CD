* We are using WSL ubuntu terminal to connect our repo
    1. git clone "github repo"
    2. git commit -m
    3. git push (to send changes)
* Git push will ask for github login but will not allow to use password
* So we need to generate a PAT to use as password or Source Control or make our first git push through VS Code
    - Source Control -> Manage Unsafe Repositories -> select the repo -> write the message -> Commit
